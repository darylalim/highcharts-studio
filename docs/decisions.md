# Decisions

The arguments and incidents behind rules stated tersely elsewhere.

`CLAUDE.md` states the **rule** and the **command**; per-type design detail lives in
[`chart-types.md`](chart-types.md); this file carries the **argument** and the
**incident** — the reasoning that justifies a rule, and the bug that bought it. None of
it is needed resident in a context window to work on the project, but all of it is what
the next decision should be reasoned from. Nothing here is history for its own sake: each
entry exists because a rule elsewhere looks arbitrary without it.

## Packaging: the fact with no second home

`tests/test_packaging.py` guards the licensing metadata, the README's badges and table of
contents, and `CHANGELOG.md`'s newest entry against `pyproject.toml`'s `version`. That
last guard closed the suite's own blind spot.

`version` was the single packaging fact with **no second home**. Every other fact in the
file was stated twice — the SPDX `license` field against the `LICENSE` text, the `NOTICE`
layers against the README's `## License` section — so any of them could be checked by
comparing the copies. `version` was stated once, so unlike every other it could neither
drift nor be checked. It duly went stale: **five chart types shipped under `0.6.0`**
because nothing asked the number to move.

The fix was to give it a second home rather than to write a smarter test — `CHANGELOG.md`'s
top `## [x.y.z]` heading — which is why a bump that ships without notes now fails the
suite. This is the same mechanical-sync idea as
`test_theme_colors_stay_in_sync_with_config`, and the generalization is the rule the docs
now follow everywhere: **a fact with one home decays silently.**

## CI: one gates job rather than three

The three gate jobs (Ruff, ty, pytest) were collapsed into a single `gates` job that
`uv sync --locked` **once**. The obvious cost of collapsing is that a job stops at its
first failing step, which would make one job strictly *less* informative than three — a
push whose lint failed would say nothing about types or tests.

What buys the informativeness back is the guard on each gate step:

```yaml
if: ${{ !cancelled() && steps.sync.outcome == 'success' }}
```

`!cancelled()` is what makes a step run even though an earlier step failed, so a single
push reports lint **and** type **and** test status rather than only the first to break —
while a failed step still fails the job. The `steps.sync.outcome` half keeps that from
degenerating: if the dependency sync itself failed there is nothing meaningful to run, and
three more red steps would be noise rather than signal.

Ordering is deliberate too: Ruff and ty run before pytest, so a lint or type error reports
in seconds rather than after the suite.

## Release: two bumps in one push

The `release` job cuts a tag and a GitHub release for *every* `CHANGELOG.md` version above
the latest released one, not merely for the current version. That is load-bearing, not
thoroughness.

`0.10.0` and `0.11.0` both reached `main` before either was released. A job that released
only the version currently in `pyproject.toml` would have tagged `0.11.0` and left
`0.10.0` un-released **forever** — the watermark moves past it, so no later push ever
reconsiders it. Releasing everything above the watermark makes the job self-healing
instead: a version missed for any reason ships on the next push.

Each version is tagged at the commit that *declares* it — HEAD for the current one, else
the bump commit located by a `git log -S` pickaxe over `pyproject.toml`, which is why the
checkout is `fetch-depth: 0`. Notes are sliced out of `CHANGELOG.md` verbatim, and only
the highest version gets `--latest`.

The top-level `concurrency` cancels superseded runs for **PRs only**. Main pushes
serialize instead, because a release job killed mid-run can strand a pushed tag with no
release attached to it — a state no later push repairs, since the tag already exists.

## Release: the watermark that failed open

`to-release LATEST_TAG` **raises** on a watermark that is present but is not a changelog
version. It used to fail *open* and return every version in the file, which would
resurrect the deliberately release-less `0.1.0`–`0.6.0` tags as six spurious releases.

The workflow feeds it a watermark only from a `gh` call whose failure is an **error**.
`gh release view` exits 1 both for "no releases yet" and for a transient 5xx, and
swallowing that status made a blip read as the former. The consequence was quiet and
permanent: the "no releases yet" branch releases only the current version, so a 5xx during
a two-bump push drops the intermediate version for good — and the job reports **green**
while doing it.

Both bugs share a shape worth recognizing: an error path that degrades to a *plausible*
answer rather than to a stop. Prefer raising.

## Permissions: why each deny rule is spelled the way it is

`uv.lock`, `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and `.git/` are protected by `permissions.deny` rules
rather than by a `PreToolUse` hook. The permission engine runs **before** any hook and
applies to every path into the filesystem, not just the tools a `matcher` names — so it
also catches a Bash output redirection (`echo … > uv.lock`), which an `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`
matcher never sees. That is strictly stronger than the `guard_paths.py` hook it replaced.

Three details make the three rules a faithful replacement:

- Claude Code consults **only** `Edit(...)` and `Read(...)` path rules, and warns at
  startup on a `Write(...)`/`MultiEdit(...)` path rule it will never check — so the one
  `Edit` rule covers all three edit tools, and writing `Write(uv.lock)` would silently
  protect nothing.
- A **bare filename** follows gitignore semantics: `Edit(uv.lock)` is `Edit(**/uv.lock)`,
  matching at any depth. That reproduces the retired hook's match-by-basename rather than
  pinning one location.
- `Read(...)` also blocks Edit and Write on the same path, so the secrets rule is a
  **`Read`** deny: it keeps the file out of the context window, which a `PreToolUse` hook
  on the edit tools could not do at all.

`.git` is additionally a built-in **protected path** (writes are never auto-approved
outside `bypassPermissions`), but that only *prompts*; the deny rule blocks outright in
every mode, which is why it is still written out rather than left to the default.

## Prose drift: why cardinals are not swept

Bare cardinals ("the four extra column selectors") are the same bug the `the one|only` and
ordinal sweeps exist for — a number in prose is a fact about the code with no second home
— and they have drifted twice: in `chart-types.md` and in `tests/test_smoke.py`'s AppTest
preamble, both saying "the four"/"the three" long after there were nine.

A sweep is nevertheless the wrong instrument for them. Widened to cardinals it turns up
**~59 hits** across the docs and the source against **~1** real one, because almost every
cardinal is structurally fixed — "the two ends of a bar", "the three builders". A signal
rate that low does not survive being run by hand on every added type; it gets skipped, and
a skipped sweep is worse than no sweep because it is still cited.

So the counts that **scale with chart types** are pinned mechanically instead, by the
docs-count tests in `tests/test_smoke.py`. The two consequences for prose are the rule
CLAUDE.md now states: a type-scaled count must appear in a form one of those tests reads,
and new prose about a type-scaled set should prefer a **rule** to a **tally**.

## The cache layer that nothing executed

`cached_chart_html` and `cached_chart_js` were covered only *indirectly*. `cached_chart_png`
was, for a long time, executed by **nothing** — the AppTests stay on the network-free
interactive path, so the Static PNG wrapper was never entered by any test at all.

It is now pinned from **two** directions, because the network and the wiring are separable
and only the network was ever worth avoiding:

- **Statically**, by two `ast` tests that read `streamlit_app.py` as source. Static
  because `import streamlit_app` **executes the whole Streamlit script** — and because it
  catches what the keyword form cannot: `goal_col=high_col` type-checks, caches, and
  renders the wrong column while every assertion about *names* passes.
- **Dynamically**, by `test_app_static_png_mode_executes_the_cached_png_wrapper`, which
  selects Static PNG for real with `highcharts_builder.build_chart_png` monkeypatched to a
  recorder, so forwarding is observed as **values** and no export server is contacted.

That dynamic test clears the `@st.cache_data` caches on the way **out** as well as in.
`monkeypatch` restores the function but not the cached *value*, so a stand-in PNG left
behind would be served to any later Static PNG render — which would then pass **without
calling the builder at all**, reintroducing the exact vacuity the test was written to end.

## Keyed widgets: the third way a picker loses its answer

The X picker and the multi-select Y picker carry a `key=` because their **labels** vary by chart
type ("Category (X) axis" against "Event labels"; "Series (Y) — one or more" against
"Rings (Y) — one or more") while their options do not, and Streamlit folds every command kwarg —
the label included — into a *keyless* widget's element id. Without a key, a relabel re-mints the
widget and discards a selection that was still entirely valid. (The single-select Y — drawn for every type that takes one
value column, xrange and timeline included — is keyless, which is why `_KEYED_PICKERS` names three
keys and not four: `x_col` plus the pills/multiselect pair, which are one control under two
commands.)

The key fixes that one failure, and there are **three**, which is the whole content of this
entry. They are worth enumerating because each has a different cause and a different fix, and
two of them look like the first:

1. **Re-minting.** A label-only change gives a keyless widget a new identity, so the answer is
   gone. Fixed by the `key=` itself. Pinned by the two label-only-switch AppTests.
2. **Filtering.** `multiselect` and `pills` do *not* reset a stored value that is no longer a
   valid option, they filter it to `[]` — so a Dataset switch lands the page on the empty-Y
   guard where the keyless version drew a chart. `selectbox` behaves differently and *resets*,
   which is why only Y carries the reconciliation seed. Pinned by
   `test_app_dataset_switch_reconciles_a_stale_y_selection`.
3. **Garbage collection.** Streamlit discards the session-state entry of any keyed widget a run
   does not **instantiate**. The key survives a rerun; it does not survive a run that never
   reaches the widget. So an early `st.stop()` above the pickers silently forgets them — the
   exact degradation the keys exist to prevent, arriving down a path the key cannot defend.
   Pinned twice, because it is one mode reached through two different stops: the vocabulary
   gate's, and the no-CSV-uploaded one's (see the end of this entry, where the second stop's
   exemption was measured away).

The third was **measured**, not deduced. On the landing dataset: choose X = `cost`, switch to
`timeline` (that frame has no date column, so the vocabulary gate errors and stops), switch back
to `line` — and X comes back at `month`. After `keep_picker_state()`, it comes back at `cost`.

Two things about that measurement are worth keeping. First, it **predates timeline**: xrange's
gate has always stopped above the same two pickers, so this release did not introduce the shape —
the failure has been live since the pickers were **keyed** in `0.18.1`, a keyless widget having
no stored entry to collect. What timeline changed is *reachability*: a frame with no coordinate
column at all is an unusual upload, while a frame with no date column is the app's own landing
dataset, two clicks from a cold start. A latent bug and an everyday
one differ only in the data, which is an argument for fixing the shape rather than the case.
Second, the fix is a **re-assignment of each entry to itself** (`st.session_state[k] =
st.session_state[k]`), the documented way to opt a key out of that cleanup. It reads as a no-op,
so it lives in a named function with the measurement attached rather than inline at the call
site — an inline no-op is what a later "simplification" deletes.

The rule for the next early stop: **a `st.stop()` above a keyed widget is a state deletion, not
a control-flow choice.** This entry granted that rule exactly one exemption, and **the exemption
did not survive being measured**. The no-CSV-uploaded `st.info(...)` + `st.stop()` further up the
sidebar has the identical shape, and it was left alone on the ground that *the user is replacing
the frame, so forgetting a column chosen against the old one is a defensible answer rather than a
loss*. The premise is false at precisely the moment that stop fires: it fires when **no file has
been uploaded**, so there is no new frame and the old one is still on screen the instant the user
goes back. Measured — X = `cost` on the landing dataset, switch Source to Upload CSV, choose
nothing, switch back to the same sample — the columns never moved, nothing was replaced, nothing
needed reconciling, and the answer was deleted anyway. `keep_picker_state()` now runs in front of
that stop too, and `test_app_backing_out_of_an_upload_does_not_forget_the_keyed_pickers` pins it.

The distinction the exemption was drawn on — *"this data cannot do that"* against *"there is no
data yet"* — was the wrong axis, and what shows it is a **third** flow neither of those names.
A **Dataset** switch also loses a selection, and is **not** a bug: X = `cost` on the landing
frame, switch to `Fruit sales`, and the picker comes back at `fruit` (measured). The sharper
rule, and the one to carry forward:

> A selection may be dropped when it **stopped being valid**. It may not be dropped when it
> merely **stopped being rendered**.

The first is **reconciliation**, and it belongs to the widget: `cost` is not a column of the fruit
frame, so the selectbox resets it (`pills`/`multiselect` filter theirs instead, which is failure
mode 2 above and why only Y carries a seed). The second is **garbage collection**, and it is not
an answer to anything — it happens because a run ended early, and it deletes a still-valid
selection exactly as readily as a stale one. The old axis **licensed** the no-CSV stop by calling
it *"there is no data yet"*; the new one refuses it, because "no data yet" describes the **run**
and the rule is about the **value** — and nothing there had invalidated a value.

That is also why preserving state in front of a stop stays safe when a file **is** uploaded and
the frame really does change. `keep_picker_state()` restores only the *stored* value; a column the
new frame does not have is still reset by the picker itself, the same mechanism the Dataset switch
above relies on. Reconciliation is not being suppressed — it is being left to the widget, the only
place that knows the new options.

So there are now **two** stops calling `keep_picker_state()`, and **no exempt early stop is left**:
the no-plottable-columns gate and the no-CSV-uploaded one are the only two `st.stop()`s in
`streamlit_app.py` that sit *above* the pickers, and every other one sits below them, where the run
has already instantiated them and there is nothing to collect. A new stop added above them inherits
the rule rather than an argument for an exception to it.

## Light mode, and its removal

`build_options`, `make_chart`, `build_chart_html` and `build_chart_png` used to take a
`dark=` flag, threaded from `st.context.theme.type` through the cached renderers. It is
gone, along with the light values it selected.

The argument for removing it: adopting the financial-dashboard theme as a single `[theme]`
locked the app to dark, so light mode became **a mode nothing could select**. Its palette
had been tuned against the other one, and the tests asserted its hexes rather than its
legibility — so it was a claim of support the suite could not actually check. Shipping an
unreachable, unverifiable mode is worse than shipping one mode.

What that trades away is **self-correction**: the chart no longer *follows* the shell, it
assumes it. `test_app_theme_is_a_single_mode_with_no_light_dark_toggle` is what makes the
assumption safe — re-adding a `[theme.light]`/`[theme.dark]` subtable is a change nothing
else in the project would object to, and it would silently un-true the assumption every
`_themed` call now makes.

The removal also renamed the constants that had carried a mode in their names
(`_HEATMAP_GRADIENT_DARK` became `_HEATMAP_GRADIENT`), which is worth knowing when reading
older commits or docs.

## The bullet goal that must be `None`

Missing data points in dict configs fed to highcharts-core use `EnforcedNull`. There is
exactly one exception, and it is exactly one slot wide: a bullet point's **goal** — the
second element of its `[measure, goal]` array — must be Python `None`.

The mechanism is why it must not be "fixed" back.
`options/series/data/bullet.py`'s `target` setter runs
`validators.numeric(value, allow_empty=True)`, which admits `None` and rejects
`EnforcedNullType` with `CannotCoerceError`. That is raised at `Chart.from_options` —
**one layer below `build_options`**. So the whole options-dict suite stays **green** while
the chart cannot be built at all, and the app's interactive path (which does not catch
builder errors) shows a bare traceback naming neither `target` nor `bullet`.

It is pinned by a test that drives `make_chart` rather than `build_options`, because that
is the only layer at which the failure is observable — a general lesson for any rule whose
violation surfaces below the function under test.

## Row-less frames: three ways a non-boolean mask breaks

A row-less frame (columns, no rows — a CSV with a header and no data) must draw an empty
chart, not raise. Every `Series.map(...)` used as a mask must therefore be
`.astype(bool)`-cast: `.map()` infers its result dtype from the values it produced, and
with no rows there are none, so it returns an empty **non-boolean** Series.

That breaks three ways, and only the first is obvious:

1. A DataFrame indexed by a non-boolean Series is read as a list of **column names**. This
   is one shared line, so it killed *every* type at once — and a new type inherits the bug
   the day it is added unless the cast is there.
2. `.sum()` of an empty string mask is `''`, so `int()` raises.
3. `&` between two of them raises out of the Arrow kernel, while `bool & str` merely
   *warns* today — deprecated, and it will raise in pandas 4.

The third is why `test_count_marks_casts_every_mask_not_just_the_label_one` promotes
warnings to errors: it is the only way the non-label casts are observable at all today.

## `color-scheme`: why the pin sits on the SVG

`build_chart_html` pins the chart's `color-scheme` to `only light` via
`_LIGHT_COLOR_SCHEME_CSS`, on the `.highcharts-root` `<svg>` — **not** on `html`.

Highcharts declares `color-scheme: light dark` on the `.highcharts-container` div between
them. Since the property inherits, that declaration shadows an `html` rule for the whole
SVG subtree, so a pin on `html` loses. The pin must sit **at or below the container** to
win.

It is needed because Highcharts ≥ 13 expresses its own defaults as `light-dark()` CSS
variables: any color the project does *not* set explicitly would follow the **viewer's
browser** rather than the project's theme. The export server already rasterizes with the
light resolution, so pinning it makes the two render modes agree and leaves `_themed` the
single source of truth for dark mode.

The general rule that falls out: anything a new chart type wants themed must go through
`build_options`, never through a Highcharts default.

## Palette: the scale that was a palette by accident

`DEFAULT_COLORS` **is** `.streamlit/config.toml`'s `chartCategoricalColors`, copied by
hand because no theme CSS reaches an iframe or a server-side PNG.

**The first incident, and the guard it left.** The bundled financial-dashboard template
set `grayColor` and `chartCategoricalColors[6]` to the same `#94a3b8`, and
`_DARK_CHROME["muted"]` copies `grayColor` — so a seven-series chart drew its seventh
series in exactly the axis-label colour, at **1.00:1**. The fix was one entry (pink at
index 6, the template's one deviation), but the durable part was
`test_no_series_colour_collides_with_the_chart_chrome`, which asserts *identity* rather
than a contrast floor: a series and a gridline may legitimately sit close, but being the
same string is never a design call.

**The second incident, which that guard could not see.** The rest of the template's scale
stayed. It was the Tailwind **-400 step of eight hues** — harmonious, and a chart palette
only by accident. Every entry sat at L\* 64-81, a 17-point band, so **hue was the only
channel carrying series identity**; when hue collapses, nothing is left. Measured in
CIEDE2000 with dichromacy simulated (Machado-Oliveira-Fernandes 2009, severity 1.0), four
of its 28 pairs fell below ΔE 20 in normal vision — blue/sky **11.7**, red/pink 18.6,
yellow/orange 18.9, blue/violet 19.3 — and six below ΔE 12 under deuteranopia, where
`#60a5fa` and `#a78bfa` came out **0.31 apart**: one colour, for roughly 6% of men, at
slots 0 and 2, which is where a three-series chart puts them.

Every assertion in the suite passed. The hexes differed, none was a chrome value, all
cleared contrast against the background. The identity guard asks whether two roles are
the same *string*; this asks whether two series are the same *colour to a viewer*, and
that question had no second home at all. It does now:
`test_no_palette_pair_collapses_under_colour_vision_deficiency`, over **all** pairs rather
than adjacent ones — of 29 types, treemap, sunburst, networkgraph, scatter and bubble
place marks by data, so no ordering can keep a given pair apart on screen. (Heatmap is
*not* one of them, though an earlier draft of this sentence said so: it colours by
`colorAxis` and never renders a categorical hue at all.)

**What replaced it.** A scale searched under this codebase's own constraints rather than
chosen by eye — because eye is exactly what fails here: every hand-assembled candidate
tried, including one built entirely from recognisable Tailwind steps, scored **worse than
3.0** on the same measure. Trichromatic intuition cannot see the failure mode.

Three findings are worth keeping whichever palette ships next:

- **Slot 0 stays.** It is the most-loaded value in the module — the single-series default,
  `_WATERFALL_SUM_COLOR`, bullet's bar, dumbbell's after-state — and Streamlit's accent
  besides. Freeing it was measured at ~1.1 ΔE of extra separation for a dimmer primary,
  and declined. A palette optimiser told to maximise the worst *pair* will happily pay for
  it by dimming the one value that appears in more charts than the other seven combined.
- **The rise/fall split has only one direction.** Under deuteranopia a green and a red both
  simulate to yellows, so hue cannot separate them and lightness must. The obvious
  aesthetic objection — that on a finance-adjacent tool a loss should not whisper while a
  gain shouts — is *unbuildable*: in sRGB a saturated red that still clears 4.5:1 exists
  only between L\* 57 and 68, while a saturated green reaches 84. A fall cannot be made the
  lighter mark without ceasing to read as red. It buys prominence with **chroma** instead.
- **Sky was doing two jobs.** `#38bdf8` was simultaneously `chartCategoricalColors[5]` and
  `chartSequentialColors[5]` — a categorical *identity* and a heatmap *value* painted the
  same hex. Cyan took the slot; the ramp got its hue back.

**A rationale that was not true of its code.** `_HEATMAP_NULL`'s comment argues an empty
cell takes the gridline slate "so a missing reading reads as 'no cell here' … instead of
as a low value on the ramp". That is a claim about a colour *difference*, and it was never
measured: the ramp's cold end and the null fill were ΔE **8.7** apart, inside the
confusable band. Moving the cold end one stop up the sequential scale
(`#0c4a6e` → `#075985`) puts them at 12.5, and
`test_heatmap_low_end_is_distinguishable_from_an_empty_cell` now asserts it. The general
lesson is the useful one: **a comment that argues from a colour difference should be
pinned by that difference**, or it decays into an intention.

**Verified by rendering, twice, on questions arithmetic could not settle.** Highcharts'
`contrast` keyword picks the ink for in-mark labels on pie, treemap, heatmap and waterfall
by a YIQ threshold — and two careful analyses of the same rule reached *opposite*
conclusions about which ink the palette gets. Drawing eight tiles and asking the DOM what
colour it painted the text settled it in one call: black, on all eight, on both the old
palette and the new. Within the 4.5-12:1 contrast band this is not cosmetic — the dimmest
permitted fill takes black ink at 4.5:1 but **white** ink at only 3.96:1, so a slot that
slips under the threshold loses AA silently.

**The second-mode smell.** A constant that is written at build time and then overwritten
by `_themed` is evidence that a second mode is still hiding in the code.
`_HEATMAP_GRADIENT`, `_HEATMAP_NULL` and `_BULLET_TARGET_COLOR` were each exactly that;
each now holds its final value at its single write. Finding another is a signal to delete
a mode, not to add a branch.

**The crossbar that needs a pair.** `bullet`'s goal crossbar necessarily crosses both the
bar and the background, so a single fixed colour cannot work *in principle* — provably:
the two 3:1 luminance ranges do not overlap. It therefore carries a **fill plus a border**,
one value per surface. The testing lesson is the durable part: a mark whose legibility is
a property of a **pair** needs its test written over the pair. A per-path hex assertion
cannot see the defect, and did not.

## The strings highcharts-core emits unquoted

`to_js_literal` writes some Python strings into the emitted JavaScript **without quotes**.
When it does, the chart call is not valid JavaScript at all: the browser throws a
`SyntaxError` and the iframe renders blank — while the Static PNG comes back **perfect**,
because the export path never touches this code at all: `headless_export` builds its
payload from `options.to_json()`, where a string is a JSON string and the question of
quoting does not arise. So the two render modes disagree and only the interactive one is
wrong, which is the class of bug `_LIGHT_COLOR_SCHEME_CSS` exists to close, arriving
through a completely different door.
No assertion over an options dict can see either of the two cases below; both are only
visible in `Chart.to_js_literal()` output.

**Case one: a format string that looks like an object.** A string that opens with `{` and
closes with `}` is handed to `js_literal_functions.is_js_object`, which calls it a JavaScript
object literal — and writes it through bare — when it carries **at least as many colons as
brace-pairs**. That is the real predicate, read off the source and confirmed by round-trip, and
it is not "a `:` between the braces": a string that has a colon but too few of them falls
through to the library's `esprima` path, which parses `const testName = <the string>` and
returns `False` on anything that is not an `ObjectExpression`. One pair and one colon is the
common case, and the trap. (With **no** colon at all there are three further bare paths, all
verified by round-trip: braces enclosing nothing but whitespace, the substring `new ` anywhere in
the string, and the substring `Object.create(`. So `{point.name} new value {point.y}` is emitted
bare — worth knowing before anyone concludes that a colon is the thing to avoid. None is reachable
today, and for a reason worth keeping true: every format this module builds that both opens `{` and
closes `}` is a fixed token string with no column name interpolated into it, and every format that
does interpolate one ends in markup or a bare word instead — checked across all 30 types.)

```text
xAxis.labels.format = "{value:%b %Y}"                    ->  format: {value:%b %Y}
xAxis.labels.format = "{value}"                          ->  format: '{value}'
dataLabels.format   = "{point.y:.1f}"                    ->  format: {point.y:.1f}
dataLabels.format   = "{point.name}"                     ->  format: '{point.name}'
tooltip.pointFormat = "{point.x:%Y-%m-%d}"               ->  pointFormat: {point.x:%Y-%m-%d}
tooltip.pointFormat = "<b>{point.name}</b><br/>{point.x:%Y-%m-%d}"  ->  quoted
dataLabels.format   = "{point.name}: {point.y}"          ->  quoted   (2 pairs, 1 colon)
dataLabels.format   = "{point.name}: {point.y:.1f}"      ->  format: {point.name}: {point.y:.1f}
```

The rule is a property of the **value**, on **any key and any axis**. This is worth
stating loudly because the project got it wrong in the other direction first: the trap was
found on `xAxis.labels.format` and written up as a fact about that key, with `dataLabels`'
and the series tooltip's `format`/`pointFormat` explicitly *cleared* as "quoted
correctly" — a clearance the table above shows is false for exactly the values that break.
`timeline`'s tooltip is safe only because it opens with `<b>`; an edit that "simplified" it
by dropping the markup would have blanked the chart, and the prose would have said the edit
was fine. The `{point.name}: {point.y}` that pie, funnel and pyramid all share is the
ILLUSTRATION of the counting rule rather than an
exception to it: it opens and closes with braces and carries a colon, and survives on the
arithmetic alone — two brace-pairs against one colon, so `is_js_object` falls through to its
`esprima` path, which refuses to parse it. It escapes by **one colon**, and that is a live margin
rather than a comfortable one: `{point.name}: {point.y:.1f}`, the same format with a precision
added and the most ordinary edit anyone would make to it, is two colons against two pairs and goes
straight through bare (round-tripped, last row of the table above).
`test_no_supported_type_emits_an_unquoted_format_object` was written value-shaped from the
start: it greps every supported type's emitted JS with `[A-Za-z]*[Ff]ormat:\s*\{`, and the
optional prefix and the capital `F` are the point of the pattern rather than tidiness — the key
this module emits on nearly every tooltip is `pointFormat`, which the literal `format: {` does
not match at all. So only the prose
needed correcting — which is the argument for testing the **serializer's output** rather
than the module's intentions, and a standing warning against "simplifying" that regex to match a
prose paraphrase of it, which would reopen exactly the tooltip case this paragraph is about.

**Case two: any string beginning `Date`.** This one is a library bug, not a rule this
module can follow its way around. `highcharts_core/js_literal_functions.py:374` (the pinned
1.11.0) serializes a bare string with the following — quoted verbatim, which is why the
fence below says `text` rather than `python`: the format gate reaches ```python fences in
Markdown, and it must not restyle someone else's source out from under a line number:

```text
if (item.startswith('[') or item.startswith('Date')) and item != 'Date':
    as_str += f"""{item}"""      # emitted UNQUOTED
```

The intent is plainly to pass `Date.UTC(...)` and `[...]` expressions through as code. The
effect is that **any** string beginning `Date`, except exactly `"Date"`, reaches the page
as raw JavaScript. It is reachable from three ordinary channels, each verified against the
pinned `highcharts-core` (1.11.0):

```text
chart title   "Dates that mattered"  ->  text: Dates that mattered
column name   "Date added"           ->  name: Date added,   (and an axis title)
event name    "Dates finalised"      ->  name: Dates finalised
```

It is **case-sensitive**, so `date added` is safe and `Date added` is not, and the exact
string `"Date"` is spared by the `item != 'Date'` clause — so a column named `Date` draws
fine while `Dates` does not, which is not a distinction anyone will guess. It is
pre-existing and affects **all 30 chart types** — the title is a free-text box and a column
name comes from the user's CSV — but `timeline` raises the exposure sharply, because its
required column is semantically a date and `Dates`, `Date added` and `DateTime` are all
natural headers. (`sample_data`'s milestone dataset spells its column lowercase, which is
what keeps the shipped sample out of it.)

**Why it is documented rather than worked around.** Every available fix mutates text the
**user typed**. Quoting it ourselves is not available — the module hands `Chart.from_options`
a dict and the library owns the serialization — so the workaround would have to change the
string: prefix it, rename the column, or slip in a zero-width space to defeat the
`startswith` test. That last one is the tempting one and it is the worst: the space is
invisible in the emitted JS, so it would silently reach the DOM, the axis title, the
tooltip, the PNG and anything a user copies out of them, to defeat a prefix check. A chart
that quietly retitles itself is a worse failure than a chart that does not draw, and it
would also be *permanent*, outliving the upstream fix by however long nobody noticed.
Renaming a user's column is the same offence with a plainer face. So the trade taken is:
**live with the bug, and pin it.**

`test_a_string_beginning_with_date_is_emitted_unquoted_by_the_library` therefore asserts
the bug is **still there**, not that it is fixed. That is the only mechanism by which a
repo that chose to live with something learns that the thing changed: fixed upstream, the
test fails and this section comes out; widened upstream, it fails too. It is the same
"pin the library's behaviour, not our hope for it" move as the silent-drop tests
(sankey's `nodeFormat`, boxplot's `fillColor`, the gauge pane's `size`), pointed at a
serializer instead of a validator.

The general rule that falls out, and the reason this sits in a decisions file rather than
in a comment: **a trap in the serializer belongs to every type, including the ones not yet
written.** Sweep it over `SUPPORTED_TYPES` and assert on the emitted JS, never on the
options dict, and never on the key you happened to hit it through.

## Tooltip precision: when a channel is a value's only home

`timeline`'s tooltip printed a fixed `{point.x:%Y-%m-%d}`. `date_columns` accepts an ISO-8601
column with a **clock time** in it — nothing about `2026-01-12T09:30:00Z` fails the date sniff,
and nothing should — so a deploy log with a start at 09:30 and an end at 17:45 drew two marks at
two distinct coordinates, correctly placed, whose tooltips both read `2026-01-12`. The only
channel that could tell them apart said they were the same thing.

What makes that a defect rather than a rounding is **where else the value appears, which for
this type is nowhere**. A timeline's ticks are months, its marks are points with no extent, its
dataLabels carry the event's *name*, and it has no axis categories and no legend. Most types
state a value more than once — an axis tick, a dataLabel, a category — so a tooltip there is a
convenience, and the handful that do not (bubble's size, variwide's width) get off lightly for a
reason given below. Here the tooltip is the value's only home, and the general rule is the one
this entry is named for: **a channel that is the only home for a value must follow that value's
granularity, because there is no second reading to correct it.** The check is mechanical — for
each value the chart claims to state, count the channels that state it **at the granularity it
has**; at one, formatting stops being cosmetic. That last qualifier is not decoration and was not
in the first draft of this rule: it is what closing the xrange case below turned up, where a
ticked axis states the endpoints *coarser* and so does not count.

Dates are where this bites first, and the reason is worth keeping: a number reaches a tooltip as
itself, while a date reaches it as the **output of a format string** — and a format string is
exactly the place granularity gets thrown away. So the same trap does not lurk in `bubble`'s
`{point.z}` or `variwide`'s width, which are also tooltip-only and also unrepeated elsewhere: no
format string, no decision, nothing discarded.

**The mechanism.** `_timeline_events` now returns a **3-tuple** — `(points, sub_day, problem)`,
`_xrange_bars`' multi-value return the precedent — and `build_options` picks `_TOOLTIP_INSTANT`
(`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`) or `_TOOLTIP_DAY` (`%Y-%m-%d`) from it. `sub_day` is returned rather than
derived by the caller because it is a **column**-level fact about the coerced values, and the
caller holds only the point dicts, whose `x` is typed `object`. It is computed as
`any(when % _MILLIS_PER_DAY for when, _ in events)`: a date parses to exact midnight UTC, so a
non-zero remainder *is* a time — arithmetic on values already coerced, not a second parse of the
strings. Measured on the round-trip:

```text
["2026-01-05", "2026-02-23"]                    -> {point.x:%Y-%m-%d}
["2026-01-05T00:00:00Z", ...]                   -> {point.x:%Y-%m-%d}
["2026-01-05T00:00:00+05:30", ...]              -> {point.x:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M}
["2026-01-12T09:30:00Z", "2026-01-12T17:45:00Z"] -> {point.x:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M}
["2026-01-05", "2026-02-23T17:45:00Z"]          -> {point.x:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M}
```

Two of those rows are the decision rather than a side effect. The **offset** row reads as an
instant because the question is asked in **UTC**, the frame the marks are actually placed in —
local midnight in `+05:30` is 18:30 the day before on the axis, so a tooltip saying only the
date would name a day the mark is not drawn on. And the **mixed** row widens *every* tooltip,
because `pointFormat` is one string per series: the choice is a column policy, not a per-point
one, and a column with any instant in it is a column whose readings are instants.

**Why not widen unconditionally**, which is the one-line version of this fix and the wrong trade
the other way: a milestone list is the type's commonest input and every one of its tooltips
would then trail a meaningless ` 00:00` — noise on the majority case to serve the minority, and
noise that *looks* like data, since a reader has no way to tell a real midnight from a padded
one. Both directions lose information; only one loses it on the rows that have it.

Two smaller notes. The formats are **named constants**, not literals inside an f-string, because
the pair is a choice and a choice with two spellings in two branches is how they drift apart —
and the branches are now in two *types* rather than two arms of one, which is what the closure
below turned that note from a tidiness into a mechanism.
And both are interpolated into a `pointFormat` that opens with `<b>`, which is what keeps the
widened one out of the unquoted-object trap above — a value that opened `{` and carried two
colons against two brace-pairs would serialize bare and blank the iframe, and
`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M` adds exactly one more colon to a string that is already close to the margin.

**Where the rule pointed next — and now goes.** `xrange` is the same shape one type over, and
saying so is the point of writing the rule down rather than the branch. Its span format already
switched — but on the **axis kind**, dates against numbers, never on granularity — so two same-day
tasks, `09:30 → 17:45` and `18:00 → 19:00`, both came back as `2026-01-12 → 2026-01-12`
(round-tripped through `build_options`). That is worse than coarse: two identical dates is
precisely how a **milestone** reads, the zero-length span xrange deliberately floors to a visible
sliver, so the tooltip did not merely lose the hours, it stated a different kind of event.

This entry first recorded that case as identified and deferred, on scope rather than principle:
the exposure looked lower, since an xrange's two ends land on a real ticked axis (its own entry's
argument for printing nothing in the mark) where a timeline point sits between month ticks, and
the fix would change a shipped type's tooltip. **Both halves of that are now retired, and the
first was wrong on its own terms.** The ticked axis is a second reading of the mark's
*placement*, and the defect was never a placement defect — the coordinates are distinct and the
bars are drawn exactly where they belong (the test asserts the two SPANS are distinct, which is
the half that matters: two bars a reader must tell apart). What has no second reading is
the *endpoint as a value*, which the axis states only to tick resolution — and that is the
**generalization the closure buys**, worth more than the fix: the rule is not *the only channel*
but *the only channel at this granularity*, so a value that appears elsewhere **coarser** is a
value with one home, and "there is an axis" is not a defence. "Lower exposure" was measuring the
wrong quantity. The second half is a real cost and simply not a large one: the changed tooltip
is a **strict refinement** — a whole-day Gantt, which is the shipped sample and the commoner
input, is byte-identical, and only a frame that carries hours sees anything new. A rule that
declines to apply the first time it points somewhere is not a rule; it is the branch it was
written to replace.

**The mechanism, one type over.** `_xrange_bars` returns a **5-tuple**,
`(points, lanes, is_datetime, sub_day, problem)`, and the span interpolates the same
`_TOOLTIP_INSTANT` / `_TOOLTIP_DAY` pair. Every detail above carries over — including the UTC
answer, since a column of `+05:30` midnights widens an xrange's span exactly as it widens a
timeline's tooltip (round-tripped) — and this shape adds one the other cannot have. The flag
is accumulated **in the drawn-bar loop** rather than derived from `points` afterwards, which is
timeline's reason restated — a point's `x` is typed `object`, so the modulo would need a cast the
loop already avoids — and it is accumulated *after* the `_spannable` skip, so a dropped bar's
hours cannot widen a tooltip that will never mention it. It stays a **column policy**: one timed
row among whole-day ones widens every tooltip in the chart (measured), because `pointFormat` is
one string per series. And widening unconditionally is still the wrong trade the other way, so
the day form is pinned as hard as the instant one. The addition is a **third** case the timeline
shape cannot have: on a **numeric** axis the span prints bare coordinates, so there is no
precision to pick, and `sub_day` is reported `False` there (`sub_day and is_datetime`) rather
than as the meaningless remainder of a plain number modulo a day's worth of milliseconds. All
three cases are pinned by `test_xrange_span_keeps_the_time_when_the_data_carries_one` — the
interesting part being that they stay three.

**Two things the closure forced, both worth more than the diff that caused them.** First, the
constants were `_TIMELINE_DAY` / `_TIMELINE_INSTANT` and are now `_TOOLTIP_DAY` /
`_TOOLTIP_INSTANT`: they were named for the type that introduced them, and xrange — the very next
thing the rule touched — picks from the same pair, so a **type name on a shared constant is
already a lie**. The
next type the rule reaches would either rename it or, worse, copy it. Second, `explain_xrange_error`
read `_xrange_bars(...)[3]` for its `problem`, and inserting `sub_day` at slot 3 quietly moved
`problem` to slot 4: the read stopped meaning "the reason these columns can't share an axis" and
started meaning "is this a date axis", **without changing**. Here `ty` caught it, because the
function is annotated `-> str | None` and a `bool` is not — but that defence is a coincidence of
the two types rather than a property of the read, and it disappears the moment a future slot is
also `str | None`. It is now a full named unpack, which breaks at the read whatever the types are.
The general form: **a positional index into a tuple that can grow is a silent rename**, and the
only reliable objection to it is a name.

Last, the **way it was found**, which is the transferable part. This type had been verified by
rendering repeatedly — the spine hue, the sorted order, the dataLabel stagger, the 600px
truncation were all decided by looking at pictures. None of those pictures could have shown
this, because every frame rendered had day granularity: rendering only ever checks the data you
rendered. It took a **review** asking what `date_columns` admits that the samples do not. When a
picker is deliberately widened past the shipped samples — as this one is, to `_COORD_EMPTY` and
to full ISO-8601 — the admitted-but-never-rendered cases are exactly where the next defect is.

## `</script>` in user text: an encoding, not an edit

`build_chart_html` puts the chart's JS inside a `<script>` element, and the HTML parser ends
that element at the first `</script` it sees, case-insensitively, **even inside a JS string**.
The JS carries user text in strings (labels, column names, the title), so a CSV label
`</script><b>x</b>` closed the chart's script early: checked on 2026-10-07, a page with that
label and that title had 4 closing tags for 3 script elements, and the chart did not draw.
Inside the app's sandboxed iframe that only broke the uploader's own chart. On a page someone
else embeds (plan #15's exports) it would be a script-injection hole, which is why it was fixed
before anything else.

`_escape_for_script_element` replaces every `</` with `<\/` and every `<!--` with `<\!--`. The
second is the other way in: `<!--` can switch the parser into a mode where a later `<script`
hides the real close. **Why this is not editing what the user typed:** inside a JS string `\/`
*is* `/` and `\!` *is* `!`, so the string the chart receives is byte-for-byte the original.
That holds only because every `</` and `<!--` in `to_js_literal` output sits inside a string:
the builder emits data, never a JS function. If a type ever emits a callback (a `formatter`, say)
that is no longer guaranteed, and the escape must be re-argued. Matching on `</` alone covers
`</SCRIPT` and every other spelling for free.

`test_user_text_cannot_close_the_charts_script_element` sweeps every supported type with the
payload in the title (the gauge family has no label channel) and in the label. It asserts the
document closes no more script elements than a clean build does, that no `<!--` reaches it, and
— with `esprima`, already installed with `highcharts-core` — that the escaped JS parses and its
title string decodes back to exactly what was typed. That last check is what proves the escape
touched nothing outside a string. Both halves were verified by breaking them: without the `</`
escape all 30 types fail on the tag count; without the `<!--` one, all 30 fail on the comment.

**What rendering showed, which the plan did not expect.** The chart now draws, but the label is
not shown as literal text: Highcharts treats label and title text as its own restricted HTML.
`<b>x</b>` draws a bold **x**, and `<script>` and `<!--` are stripped, so `<!--<script>` draws
as an empty label. That is Highcharts' display, not this escape (the JS string is the original,
and the test proves it), and it was true before the fix for any label with markup in it. It is
not changed here, because changing it means rewriting what the user typed; it matters again for
#15, whose embeds inherit it.

**Known limit:** a label that also *starts* with `Date` hits the library's
[unquoted-string bug](#the-strings-highcharts-core-emits-unquoted) first: it is emitted as code,
not as a string, and is broken before this escape applies.
