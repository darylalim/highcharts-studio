"""Smoke and behavior tests for the Highcharts builder and the Streamlit app.

Run with: ``uv run pytest``

Layers:

- ``build_options`` unit tests covering every supported chart type, the
  missing-data and scatter/bubble edge cases (NaN -> ``EnforcedNull`` for
  cartesian and radar series, dropped points/slices elsewhere, numeric vs
  non-numeric x, and bubble's (x, y, size) triples whose series share one size
  column, its ``highcharts-more`` module resolution, and its dimension-naming
  tooltip), non-finite data (an ``inf`` is not missing but can't be serialized —
  ``to_js_literal`` emits the bare token ``inf``, a JS ReferenceError, and the
  export server 400s — so every type applies its own missing-data policy to it,
  swept over ``SUPPORTED_TYPES``), radar's polar-line shape (chart.type "line" + ``chart.polar``,
  sharing the ``highcharts-more`` module), heatmap's category × category value
  matrix (``[x, y, value]`` cells colored by a ``colorAxis``, empty cells kept as
  ``EnforcedNull``, resolving its own ``modules/heatmap.js``), treemap's
  value-sized tiles (``{name, value}`` leaves colored categorically via
  ``colorByPoint``, missing values dropped like pie, resolving its own
  ``modules/treemap.js``), sankey's node-link flows (``{from, to, weight}`` links
  over two node columns, rows missing any of the three dropped like pie's slices,
  its node tooltip and its per-link weight labels each pinned to the one place
  highcharts-core doesn't silently drop them, those labels gated on link count,
  resolving its own ``modules/sankey.js``), boxplot's per-category Tukey
  distributions (the one AGGREGATING builder: raw observations grouped by a
  repeating ``x_col`` into positional ``[low, q1, median, q3, high]`` 5-arrays,
  outliers split off into a linked scatter series emitted only when they exist,
  the ``iqr == 0`` degeneracies that the inclusive fence saves, the matplotlib
  whisker clamp, an all-missing group kept as an ``EnforcedNull`` box, and the
  ``fillColor``/``stemColor`` silent drop that leaves its box interior unsettable —
  sharing bubble's and radar's ``highcharts-more``), waterfall's cumulative bridge
  (signed deltas floating at a running total, closed by an APPENDED ``isSum`` bar —
  so it is the one type drawing more marks than the frame has rows, and the one
  whose ``count_marks`` exceeds its drawable row count; the bar colors are semantic
  rather than identity-based, read from ``DEFAULT_COLORS`` by index so a custom
  ``colors`` palette cannot repaint a fall green, and the total carries its own
  per-point color, which takes it OFF that up/down scale — Highcharts would otherwise
  color the sum by its own sign, and "the end level is above zero" is not the claim
  "this step added"; a missing delta keeps its axis slot as an ``EnforcedNull``; the
  in-bar value labels are gated on step count; and it needs TWO dark-mode hooks — the
  bar borders and the connector lines between bars, neither of which is column/bar's
  white-ring case — while sharing that same ``highcharts-more``), sunburst's hierarchy
  of rings (the only type reading the frame as an ADJACENCY LIST — one row per node,
  naming its parent by LABEL — so its marks must be ASSEMBLED before anything can be
  drawn. Node ids are SYNTHESIZED, never the labels: two teams may legitimately both be
  called "Other", and label-as-id would hand Highcharts a duplicate id, which is not a
  silent mismatch but error #31 printed in a red band across the chart — so the twins stay
  two honest sectors, and the label-keyed shape's one real cost is paid only where it is
  genuinely unpayable, on a duplicate label that is USED as a parent. The tree's two kinds
  of fault are kept apart: MISSING DATA is dropped (a dangling parent, with its descendants
  — Highcharts would otherwise silently re-parent an orphan to the root; an unsizable leaf
  value, ``_sizable`` widening ``_plottable`` by one comparison because a NEGATIVE leaf is
  not merely undrawn but excluded from its parent's sum), while a CONTRADICTION RAISES (a
  cycle, an ambiguous parent) — through a message ``_sunburst_tree`` RETURNS rather than
  throws, which is what keeps ``count_marks`` total and the app's KPI row, which runs above
  its guards, from blowing the page up with a traceback. Internal nodes carry NO value, so
  Highcharts' sum is authoritative and a parent's arc always equals what is drawn under it;
  a root sector is APPENDED, making sunburst the second type whose mark count exceeds its row
  count; ring 1 is seeded per POINT from the palette, routing around ``levels[].colorByPoint``,
  which highcharts-core silently drops, and around the series-level ``colorByPoint``, which
  survives but would destroy the hue inheritance; and it needs ONE dark-mode hook, the white
  sector rings that pie, treemap and sankey each dissolve — resolving its own
  ``modules/sunburst.js`` and, unlike bubble/radar/boxplot/waterfall, no ``highcharts-more``),
  the brand-palette
  (``DEFAULT_COLORS`` / ``colors`` override), and the validation guards
  (unsupported type, empty ``y_cols``, the category-x x-in-y rule widened to
  heatmap, boxplot and waterfall, the bubble size-column requirement, sankey's
  required, distinct target column, and sunburst's required, distinct parent column).
- light/dark theming: dark mode paints the chart background (light leaves it
  unset), the chart chrome (axes/text/gridlines, pie labels, and the tooltip)
  flips while the ``DEFAULT_COLORS`` palette stays shared across modes,
  ``build_chart_html`` gives the iframe body a background that tracks the mode,
  and it pins the chart's ``color-scheme`` so Highcharts' own ``light-dark()``
  defaults resolve to the export server's values rather than the viewer's browser.
- a row-less frame (columns, no rows — a header-only CSV) draws an EMPTY chart
  rather than raising, swept over ``SUPPORTED_TYPES`` because the bug was one
  shared line: an empty ``.map()`` mask comes back non-boolean, and a DataFrame
  indexed by one is read as a list of COLUMN NAMES, so every type died with a bare
  ``KeyError``. ``count_marks`` had the same bug in each of its three masks, where
  it surfaces instead as ``int('')`` and as an Arrow ``&`` kernel error — and, for
  the non-label masks, only as a pandas deprecation, so that test promotes warnings
  to errors to see it at all.
- ``sample_data`` unit tests: every built-in dataset is plottable (fresh,
  non-empty, with a numeric column).
- Headless ``AppTest`` interaction tests that drive the full Streamlit app's
  control flow — switching chart type (including bubble, which reveals a
  Size (Z) control, radar, heatmap, treemap, sankey, which reveals a
  Target (to) control, sunburst, which reveals a Parent one, and boxplot and waterfall,
  which reveal a single-select Y
  and no extra control at all — waterfall also asserting that its Steps KPI counts
  the appended total, and sunburst that its Sectors KPI counts the appended root, and
  that a CYCLIC uploaded CSV — the one builder error a user can reach by uploading a
  file, since the interactive path does not catch — warns and stops rather than
  rendering a traceback), title, and series, revealing
  the generated Highcharts config
  behind its toggle, the KPI metric row, the wide-CSV multiselect fallback, and
  the render-mode selector's two modes (interactive iframe / static PNG), plus
  tripping the x-in-y warning and the no-CSV-uploaded info guard — asserting on
  the generated config (incl. the brand palette) and the guard messages.

    The second label column ("target") is there for sankey alone, whose links need a
    node column at each end, and the third ("parent") for sunburst alone, whose rows are
    an adjacency list. Every other type names the columns it reads, so the extras are
    inert (neither is numeric, so neither can perturb a y-column sweep).

    "parent" is a real 2-level tree — "a" is a top-level branch (its blank parent says so)
    and "b"/"c" hang off it — so the sweeps exercise sunburst's internal-node path as well
    as its leaves. Note the consequence for the value sweeps: "a" has children, so its
    value is never read at all (an internal node's arc is the sum of its children's).

    The fourth column ("end") is for xrange alone, whose bars need a coordinate at each end.
    It is the one extra that IS numeric, so — unlike "target"/"parent" — it is not inert:
    it is a second numeric column, and "value" is no longer the only one. Every sweep names
    the columns it reads, so nothing is perturbed, but a new test that reaches for "the
    numeric column" must now say which. Its values sit strictly above "value"'s, so for

    `borderColor` is the ordinary dissolve, shared with column/bar/xrange/columnrange and NOT
    waterfall — joined on a MEASUREMENT rather than an inference, since waterfall is the standing
    proof the shared bar base class settles nothing (its border is a fixed #333333, while bullet's
    bars come back crisply ringed white). `targetOptions.color` is the only hook in this module
    that flips a MARK rather than chrome: the crossbar is drawn at 140% of the bar width, so it
    necessarily spans TWO backgrounds at once — the bar (a constant palette blue in both themes)
    and the chart background (white -> slate) — and a fixed colour therefore cannot work in
    PRINCIPLE, not merely in practice.

    The dark hue is asserted at its PATH in the option tree and in the serialized JS at the level
    it was written to, never as a bare `"#e2e8f0" in js`: that string is `_DARK_CHROME["text"]`,
    which `_themed` writes to the title, both axis label styles and the tooltip on EVERY dark
    chart, so the substring test would pass with this hook deleted outright — the one thing it

    exact invisibility the hook exists to prevent (see

    The light -> dark -> light ORDER is the third thing here, and the third build is the one that
    earns it: `_themed` INDEXES this key rather than `setdefault`ing it, so were the branch to emit

# Variwide: columns whose WIDTH is a second magnitude
#
# Variwide rides SUPPORTED_TYPES and is threaded through the sweeps by `_width_for`, so the
# palette, the dark background, the light no-op, the non-finite-literal ban, the end-to-end
# serialization, the label-drop policy and the row-less frame are ALREADY covered there and are
# not restated below. What is here is what only variwide can say.
#
# Two facts shape almost every test in this block, and both were established by RENDERING:
#
#   1. The width survives POSITIONALLY. The literal key `z` never reaches the emitted JS, so this
#      module's dominant `assert "..." in js` idiom is INVERTED here, exactly as it is for bullet.
#   2. A width is a SHARE OF A TOTAL. So a bad width does not merely fail to draw its own bar —
#      it drops out of the denominator and silently makes every OTHER bar wider. That is why the
#      null policy is all-or-nothing and why the width takes `_sizable` rather than `_plottable`.

# These drive the UI control flow, not chart correctness (the builder tests
# above own that). The rendered chart lives in an opaque st.iframe that AppTest
# can't see into, but the "generated config" toggle reveals the Highcharts JS
# literal via st.code — so, after switching that toggle on, we assert the
# controls actually reach the builder. (It's a toggle rather than an expander
# because a collapsed expander body still runs on every rerun; the toggle skips
# building the JS until asked, and unlike an expander AppTest can switch it on.)
# Sidebar widgets are addressed by position: selectbox [0] Dataset, [1] Chart
# type, [2] X axis; segmented_control [0] Source, [1] Render mode; pills [0] the
# Y series (a wide CSV upload swaps these pills for a multiselect); toggle [0] the
# generated-config reveal. Those indices hold for every type, because the three
# type-specific extra controls are created *after* the X selectbox: bubble's
# "Size (Z)", sankey's "Target (to)" and sunburst's "Parent". All three are addressed by
# LABEL rather than index, since they shift the widgets that follow them. The Upload CSV
# path shifts them again — it has no Dataset selectbox — so a test on that path addresses
# "Chart type" by label too. Everything here stays on
# the network-free interactive path (the Static PNG mode would call the export
# server).
