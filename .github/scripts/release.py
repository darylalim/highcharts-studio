"""Release automation for highcharts-studio.

Stdlib-only, importable, and runnable as a CLI. The ``release`` job in
``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` calls it to cut a tag + GitHub release for every
version that has reached ``main`` above the latest released one — so a merged
version bump can never sit un-released again, even when *two* bumps land in one
push. (The drift this closes: the code reached ``0.11.0`` on ``main`` while the
newest GitHub release was still ``0.9.0``, because tagging + releasing was a
manual step that lagged the merge; and both ``0.10.0`` and ``0.11.0`` were merged
before either was released, which is exactly the multi-bump case a
release-only-the-current-version job would skip.)

The facts a release needs — the current version, the changelog notes, and which
versions still need releasing — are all *read* from ``pyproject.toml`` and
``CHANGELOG.md`` (the notes are the ``CHANGELOG.md`` section verbatim and cannot
drift from it; the changelog↔version pinning is
``tests/test_packaging.py::test_changelog_documents_the_current_version``, which
now reuses ``changelog_versions`` here rather than re-encoding the heading regex).
The pure, importable functions carry every decision so ``tests/test_release.py``
can cover them with no subprocess and no network — the ``.claude/hooks/`` pattern
applied to release tooling. ``main()`` is the thin file-IO/stdout wrapper the
workflow calls; the impure parts a release also needs (the latest-release tag via
``gh``, the bump commit via ``git``) stay in the workflow, which passes the
``gh``-derived latest tag into ``to-release``.
